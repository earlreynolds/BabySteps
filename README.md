First Project in Python And Pygame
Requires Python 2.7 and Pygame to run.

This is a very basic 2D RPG engine I wrote over a couple of months in 2013. It was written for learning purposes. I have no 
plans to complete or develop this project.

The player is in the shape of a cat. S/he can interact with a stick figure and a giant, disembodied head, and go through
doors to other areas.

The character is controlled through the keyboard. Arrow keys move the player. Holding "A" increases player speed. Pressing
"D" while adjacent to a door will trigger a level transition. Pressing "D" while adjacent to a non-playable character will
trigger a dialogue at the bottom of the screen. Pressing "B" again progresses this dialogue until finished.
